# THEMES

## Ideology
When starting a new project the last thing I want to have to do is go through every component and change basic styles to match my projects theme.

This template attempts to resolve that with a global theme object that declares certain styles such as whether to include shadows, radius, colours, etc. The theme object is deconstructed and css classes are built and applied as necessary by the template, removing much of the manual tedious labour of styling a new project.
